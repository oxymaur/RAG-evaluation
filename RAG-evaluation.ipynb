    "### Task: Create a Retriever for the Vector Store\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, you will create a retriever to query the vector store and fetch the most relevant text chunks for a given input query. The retriever uses the vector embeddings to perform similarity-based searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "1. **Create the Retriever:**\n",
    "   - Use the `as_retriever` method on the `vector_store` to create a retriever.\n",
    "   - Set the `search_type` parameter to `\"mmr\"` (Maximal Marginal Relevance) to ensure diverse and relevant retrieval.\n",
    "   - Pass additional search settings using `search_kwargs`, such as:\n",
    "     - **`k`:** The number of chunks to retrieve (e.g., `k=3`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Assign the Retriever:**\n",
    "   - Store the retriever in the variable `retriever` for later use in querying the vector store.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Verify the Retriever:**\n",
    "   - Ensure the retriever is correctly initialized and ready to handle queries.\n",

    "### Task: Build a RAG Model Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will combine all the steps from the previous tasks to create a reusable function for building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model. The function will process raw text documents, generate embeddings, and store them in a vector store for efficient retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You Need to Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Function:**\n",
    "   - Create a function named `build_rag_model` with the following parameters:\n",
    "     - **`texts` (List[str]):** A list of raw documents or text strings to process.\n",
    "     - **`embedding_model` (str):** The name of the Hugging Face embedding model to use.\n",
    "     - **`chunk_size` (int):** The maximum size of each text chunk.\n",
    "     - **`chunk_overlap` (int):** The overlap size between consecutive chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Implement the Steps:**\n",
    "   - **Step 1:** **Split Text into Chunks**\n",
    "     - Use `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to split the provided `texts` into chunks.\n",
    "     - Ensure the function handles all documents in the list and combines the resulting chunks.\n",
    "     - Print the number of generated chunks for debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Step 2:** **Generate Embeddings**\n",
    "     - Initialize a `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` object using the provided `embedding_model`.\n",
    "     - Use this object to generate embeddings for the text chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Step 3:** **Create a Vector Store**\n",
    "     - Use `Chroma.from_texts` to create a vector store from the chunks and their embeddings.\n",
    "     - Print the number of chunks stored in the vector store for confirmation.\n",

    "3. **Return the Vector Store:**\n",
    "   - The function should return the vector store so it can be used for retrieval tasks.\n",

    "### Task: Define a Generative Model for Question Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will define and initialize a generative model that can answer user questions based on a given context. This involves creating a prompt template, setting up an output parser, and initializing the language model for generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What You Need to Do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the Prompt Template:**\n",
    "   - Use the `PromptTemplate` class to define a template that specifies how user questions and the associated context are structured.\n",
    "   - Your template should:\n",
    "     - Include placeholders for the context (`{context}`) and question (`{question}`).\n",
    "     - Provide clear instructions for the model to generate answers based only on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initialize the Prompt Template:**\n",
    "   - Set the `template` argument to the system template:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     system_template = \"\"\"\n",
    "     Answer the users question based on the below context:\n",

    "     Here is the question: <question> {question} </question>\n",
    "     \"\"\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Specify the `input_variables` as `[\"context\", \"question\"]` to define the placeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Set Up the Output Parser:**\n",
    "   - Use the `StrOutputParser` to parse the string output from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Initialize the Generative Model:**\n",
    "   - Use the `ChatGroq` class to set up a generative model with the following parameters:\n",
    "     - **`model`:** Specify the model name (e.g., `\"llama-3.2-3b-preview\"`).\n",
    "     - **`temperature`:** Set to `0` for deterministic outputs.\n",
    "     - **`max_tokens`:** Set to `None` to allow the model to decide the output length.\n",
    "     - **`timeout`:** Set to handle timeouts during generation.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Initial treatment and objective tests**: Treat people immediately if they are acutely unwell or highly symptomatic at presentation. Perform objective tests that may help support a diagnosis of asthma, such as:\n",

      "   - Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) test\n",
      "   - Spirometry or peak expiratory flow (PEF) before and after bronchodilator\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Bronchial challenge test**: A test to measure airway responsiveness (bronchial responsiveness). It involves giving small increments of a bronchoconstrictor (most commonly methacholine) and measuring the FEV1 after each dose until it falls by a predetermined amount (usually 20% from baseline).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Bronchodilator reversibility test**: A measure of the ability to reverse obstruction in the airways using medicines that widen the airways (bronchodilators).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Other tests**: Other tests may include a bronchial hypresponsiveness test, leukotriene receptor antagonist, long-acting beta2 agonist, and long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist.\n",

    "### Critique QA Pairs Using LLM Prompts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, you will evaluate each generated QA pair using the previously defined critique prompts for **groundedness**, **relevance**, and **stand-alone clarity**. The goal is to score and document the quality of each question based on the provided context and criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What This Code Does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Iterate Over QA Outputs:**\n",
    "   - Loops through the `outputs` list, which contains the generated QA pairs (`context`, `question`, `answer`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate Evaluations:**\n",
    "   - For each QA pair:\n",
    "     - **Groundedness:** Uses the `question_groundedness_critique_prompt` to evaluate if the question is answerable based on the given context.\n",
    "     - **Relevance:** Uses the `question_relevance_critique_prompt` to evaluate if the question is useful for the intended audience.\n",
    "     - **Stand-alone Clarity:** Uses the `question_standalone_critique_prompt` to evaluate if the question is understandable without additional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Call the LLM for Each Criterion:**\n",
    "   - Sends the formatted prompt for each criterion to the LLM using `call_llm`.\n",
    "   - Stores the response in the `evaluations` dictionary under the respective criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Parse the Results:**\n",
    "   - Extracts the **`Total rating`** (score) and **`Evaluation`** (text rationale) from the LLM's response.\n",
    "   - Updates the `output` dictionary with the scores and evaluations for each criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handle Errors Gracefully:**\n",
    "   - If any part of the process fails (e.g., LLM output is malformed), the loop skips the current QA pair and continues with the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Update Outputs:**\n",
    "   - Adds the critique scores and rationale to each QA pair in the `outputs` list.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Convert QA Pairs to a DataFrame:**\n",
    "   - `generated_questions = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(outputs)`:\n",
    "     - Converts the `outputs` list (which now includes QA pairs and their scores) into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Display the Evaluation Dataset (Before Filtering):**\n",
    "   - Prints a subset of columns:\n",
    "     - **`question`:** The generated question.\n",
    "     - **`answer`:** The corresponding answer.\n",
    "     - **`groundedness_score`, `relevance_score`, `standalone_score`:** Scores assigned during the critique step.\n",
    "   - This provides an overview of the dataset before applying any filtering criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Filter the QA Pairs:**\n",
    "   - Keeps only QA pairs that meet the following conditions:\n",
    "     - **`groundedness_score` >= 4:** The question is well-anchored in the provided context.\n",
    "     - **`standalone_score` >= 4:** The question is clear and understandable without additional context.\n",
    "   - **Note:** The `relevance_score` is not used for filtering here, but it remains part of the dataset for reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Display the Filtered Dataset:**\n",
    "   - Prints the filtered DataFrame to show the high-quality QA pairs that passed the criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Convert to a Hugging Face Dataset:**\n",
    "   - `eval_dataset = datasets.Dataset.from_pandas(generated_questions, split=\"train\", preserve_index=False)`:\n",
    "     - Converts the filtered pandas DataFrame into a Hugging Face `Dataset` object, which is commonly used for training and evaluation in NLP tasks.\n",
    "     - The `split=\"train\"` argument designates this as a training split.\n",
    "     - `preserve_index=False` ensures the index from the pandas DataFrame is not carried over to the `Dataset`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Purpose of This Step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dataset Refinement:**\n",
    "   - Filters out low-quality QA pairs to ensure only well-scored questions and answers are included in the final dataset.\n",
    "   - Focuses on groundedness and stand-alone clarity to improve the overall utility and reliability of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Final Dataset Preparation:**\n",
    "   - Converts the data into a format suitable for further evaluation or training machine learning models, such as Hugging Face models.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quality Assurance:**\n",
    "   - Provides a visual overview of the dataset before and after filtering, allowing for manual inspection of the data quality."

    "\n",
    "This function evaluates the quality of answers generated by the RAG system using a predefined evaluation prompt and a scoring language model. The evaluation process is iterative and updates the results file in place for checkpointing and saving progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What This Function Does:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize the Evaluation Environment:**\n",
    "   - **`answer_path`:** Path to the JSON file containing the generated answers.\n",
    "   - **`eval_chat_model`:** The language model used for evaluation (e.g., GPT-4).\n",
    "   - **`evaluator_name`:** A string identifier for the evaluator (e.g., \"GPT4\").\n",
    "   - **`evaluation_prompt_template`:** The prompt template that defines how the evaluation task is framed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Load Existing Results:**\n",
    "   - If the `answer_path` file exists, loads the previously saved results into `answers`.\n",
    "   - This ensures that previously evaluated answers are not re-evaluated, saving time and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterate Over Generated Answers:**\n",
    "   - For each entry in `answers`:\n",
    "     - **Check for Prior Evaluation:** If the answer has already been evaluated by the specified evaluator (`eval_score_{evaluator_name}`), skip it.\n",
    "     - **Prepare the Evaluation Prompt:**\n",
    "       - Uses `evaluation_prompt_template` to format the instruction, response, and reference answer into the structured prompt.\n",
    "     - **Evaluate the Response:**\n",
    "       - Sends the prompt to the `eval_chat_model` (e.g., GPT-4) and receives the evaluation result.\n",
    "     - **Parse the Result:**\n",
    "       - Extracts `feedback` and `score` from the model's output, splitting on `[RESULT]` to ensure the expected format is followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Update the Results:**\n",
    "   - Adds the following fields to the current experiment:\n",
    "     - **`eval_score_{evaluator_name}`:** The numeric score assigned by the evaluator.\n",
    "     - **`eval_feedback_{evaluator_name}`:** The detailed feedback provided by the evaluator.\n",
    "   - Saves the updated `answers` list back to the `answer_path` file after each iteration for checkpointing.\n",

    "\n",
    "This script integrates all the steps covered so far to run a full evaluation of the RAG system across different configurations. It includes embedding creation, chunking, retrieval, generation, and evaluation in a loop to test multiple setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step-by-Step Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Output Directory:**\n",
    "   - Ensures that a directory named `./output` exists to store the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Configurations:**\n",
    "   - **`embedding_models`:** List of embedding models to test (e.g., `\"sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2\"`).\n",
    "   - **`chunk_sizes`:** List of `(chunk_size, overlap)` tuples to test different chunking strategies.\n",
    "     - Example:\n",
    "       - `[2000, 100]`: Chunks of 2000 characters with 100-character overlap.\n",
    "       - `[5000, 500]`: Larger chunks of 5000 characters with 500-character overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Iterate Over Configurations:**\n",
    "   - Loops through all combinations of `embedding_models` and `chunk_sizes`.\n",
    "   - Constructs a unique `settings_name` for each combination to name the output files clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Build the Knowledge Base:**\n",
    "   - Calls the `build_rag_model` function with:\n",
    "     - `texts`: The input data (e.g., pre-split chunks of the documents).\n",
    "     - `embedding_model`: The current embedding model.\n",
    "     - `chunk_size` and `chunk_overlap`: Parameters for splitting the text.\n",
    "   - Converts the resulting vector store into a retriever (`knowledge_index`) for querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Run the RAG System:**\n",
    "   - Iterates through the `eval_dataset` (assumed to contain questions and true answers).\n",
    "   - Calls the `answer_with_rag` function to:\n",
    "     - Retrieve relevant documents using the `knowledge_index`.\n",
    "     - Generate answers using the RAG chain (`rag_chain`).\n",
    "   - Appends the results to a list, including:\n",
    "     - The question, true answer, generated answer, and retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Save Results:**\n",
    "   - Saves the answers to a JSON file named based on the configuration (`output_file_name`).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Evaluate the Answers:**\n",
    "   - Calls `evaluate_answers` to:\n",
    "     - Critique and score the generated answers using the LLM evaluator (`eval_chat_model`).\n",
    "     - Update the saved results with scores and feedback for each answer.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Flexible Testing:**\n",
    "   - Tests multiple configurations for embeddings and chunking, enabling comparative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Results Storage:**\n",
    "   - Saves intermediate and final results to disk for reproducibility and further analysis.\n",

    "#### Purpose of This Step:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance Comparison:**\n",
    "   - Calculates the overall effectiveness of each configuration by averaging the normalized evaluation scores across all questions.\n",
    "   - Highlights configurations that consistently produce better results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Identify Trends:**\n",
    "   - Sorting the scores helps visualize how different configurations affect the system's performance.\n",
    "   - Useful for pinpointing the impact of factors like chunk size, overlap, or embedding model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Insights into Configurations:**\n",
    "   - Identifies which configurations yield higher-quality answers, guiding optimization efforts.\n",
    "   - Helps determine the best chunk size, overlap, or embedding model for the\n"
